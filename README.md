# Urban dictionary

The urban dictionary module for [wormbot](https://github.com/ibabushkin/wormbot)! and it's programmed in rust for some pretty rad performance.

to compile do the following:

```sh

~$ cargo build

```

If you do not have rust installed or cargo do:

```sh
~$ sudo pacman -S rust
~$ sudo apt-get install rust
```
Or compile it from source from [here](https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-1.3.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz)

You will find the binary in target/debug
